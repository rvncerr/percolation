Percolation Threshold in n-Cubes (Legacy Edition)
=================================================

Welcome to the 2015 legacy version of the Percolation Threshold in n-Cubes project, now updated with Ant build system and ease of use. This project aims to explore and analyze the critical percolation threshold within n-dimensional cubes, providing valuable insights for researchers and students in computational physics and network theory. The legacy codebase, preserved in its original form to maintain historical accuracy, has been seamlessly integrated with Apache Ant. To get started, simply clone the repository and run the `ant` command in the project root directory.
